## UX (User Experience) :control_knobs:

#### User Stories:
* As a newly pregnant woman eager to get back into fitness, I expect to find information about how experienced my new (potential) Personal Trainer is.. especially as I am pregnant. 
* As an up and coming podcaster, I want to be inspired by more experience podcasters, I want quick and easy access to their work. 
* As a new mum with __Diastasis Recti__ (post natal specific core speration), what I am looking for is pretty niche and I just want to book and pay for sessions as soon as possible.  
* As an experienced podcaster, I want to lighten my load and know if a 'podcaster' has other audio technology related skills. 
* As a user I want to be able to register my interest in any service quickly and easily. 

#### User Stories (in detail)::open_book:

#### Amiko Powsen (23/ female):

> I am absolutely terrified! I am about to have a baby and ,my body is changing and I feel totally powerless! I want to feel reassured by a professional who can help me feel that I can hold onto some of my identity! I want my trainers website to be inviting but factual. 

#### Sonnie Dosanjh (20/ Male):

> I have recently graduated as a sound engineer from Leeds uni. I have found that supporting podcasters is a great way of building work experience. I want to be able to easily reach out to a potentially podcatser not just to support them, but learn from their accumulated editing skills. 

#### Josie Benson (36/ female):
> I know exactly what I need and when I have found a trainer that can provide it, I want to be able to book their services quickly and easily, if possible, without putting my bank details in, as I can never find my card!!

### Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create a more interactive and specific version of my current website. Since the design of my first website I am a lot more tech savy and experienced and feel it is important that this shines through. I would like to create an __online extension of my personal training business and podcasting skills__. The website is aimed toward women seeking Pre and post natal specialist fitness support and anyone seeking my input on their podcast. I have used this project as an opportunity to collate all of the skills that I have developed in my experience in both fields and aim to make this website extremely easy to use and interactive enough for the user to feel that the information they wanted was easy to source. __I am paying close attention to the wordng and language__ as Pre and Post Natal exercise is still relatively new and sometimes intimidating for women, its deeply important that I do not make woemn feel that exdericsing during or thereafter their pregnancy should be prioritised over the other practical things they must do, rather as part of their self care. 

#### Site Owner Goals:
* Promote myself as a specialised Personal Trainer and Podcaster. 
* Generate a stream of new clients. 
* Provide enough information on the site to entice the types of clients with whom my expertise are best suited. 
* Display my credentials in a clear and concise format. 
* Inspire my clientelle to lead a healthier lifestyle for the right reasons, as opposed to body shaming them into trying to get fit. 
* Display all of my Podcatsing experience in an interactive and easily attainable way. 
* Insure that the site is aesthetically pleasing.

## Design Choices: üé®

I wanted the colour scheme of this project to be elicit emotions of; motivation ; conversation and health. In order to achieve this difficult blend of emotions, i needed to carry out some research on the meanings and feelings assiciated with certain colours. 
I knew vaguely that green was associated with health because of new beginnings and seasonal indications from the spring months, but had no idea how best to convey the conversationalism with the podcast aspect of my site. I found <a href='https://www.templatemonster.com/blog/warm-cool-color-psychology-web-design/'>this</a> blog post, which explained that light blue had healing associations and it is also aesthetically very profesional, when placed with a range of other colours. To decide on what the other range of colours should look like, i turned to pinterest for some <a href='https://www.pinterest.co.uk/shamastock/wellness-color-palette-ideas/'> inspiration </a> I then used <a href= 'https://coolors.co/75b9be-a8ccc9-b3d6c6-dceab2-c7d66d-2f4b26'>coolors.com</a> to help me find a fitting colour scheme, incorporating all the emotions i desired.

##### Logo:
I used a very helpful <a href="https://studio.tailorbrands.com/business/52878134/wizard/editor?currentId=3400361333&logosStepId=326203893&origBrandVersionId=3400361333&originalIndex=0">tool</a> to create the logo. I beleieved the logo should equally signify the importance of both of the skills i am using the website to advocate. I specifically chose sports looking headphones for the icon image as, they are instantly assiciated with exercise and also audio. 

##### Fonts: 
I chose to use the fonts Lato and Montserrat. After looking at other fitness/ wellness or simply, health websited, i found the two fonts regularly appearing and realised that it was probably because they are easy to read and also have the scope to be pretty impactful.


##### Colours:
I wanted the colours to exude health, professionalism and conversation. For this reason i decided on colour scheme 3, because it encapsulated all three aims. and would sit nicely beneath the logo. 




## Wireframes: üîß
I built the wireframes for this project using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq mockups</a>. In my previous project, I did not adequately plan my project, this time i wanted to really utilise the benefits of setting out my plan in detail, it saved me so much time and gave me a lot more freedom to try out different ideas, should i need to!

## Closing Notes:
Developing this project has taught me not just about coding, but methodical thinking in general. I feel that HTML and CSS are the second nature now! I have learnt the usefulness of Bootstrap and the importance of not over complicating the code.  In the future, I would like to implement other features like a live chat feature and add payment and social media links to the footer. Said online payment and social media accounts do not currently exist, but will in the future!
