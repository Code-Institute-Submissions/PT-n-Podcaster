# PT'n' Podcaster

<img src="assets/logos/logo.jpg">

Thank you for visiting my project. This website is a clear and concise reflection of my career and passion. I am a female only level 4 pre and post natal Personal Trainer and I love podcasting. After founding and hosting the tried it podcast, I went on to launch Mayas minutes and guest on countless other podcasts. I use my social media pretty heavily, but when you are relying on a mass produced algorithm you cannebver really protray the true essence of who you are and what you do, this website is me doing just that!  *if you have any questions or suggestions head to my Github contact details.* 

Happy Coding!

## UX (User Experience) :control_knobs:

#### User Stories:
* As a user, I expect to find information about how experienced my new (potential) Personal Trainer is.. __especially as I am pregnant__. 
* As a user and upcoming podcaster, I want to be inspired by more experienced podcasters, I want _quick and easy access to their work_. 
* As a user, suffering with __Diastasis Recti__ I just want to _book and pay for sessions as soon as possible_.  
* As a user, I want to __lighten my load__ and know if a 'podcaster' has _other audio technology related skills_. 
* As a user I want to be able to _register my interest in any service quickly and easily_. 

#### User Stories (in detail)::open_book:

#### Amiko Powsen (23/ female):

> I am absolutely terrified! I am about to have a baby and ,my body is changing and I feel totally powerless! I want to feel reassured by a professional who can help me feel that I can hold onto some of my identity! I want my trainers website to be inviting but factual. 

#### Sonnie Dosanjh (20/ Male):

> I have recently graduated as a sound engineer from Leeds uni. I have found that supporting podcasters is a great way of building work experience. I want to be able to easily reach out to a potentially podcatser not just to support them, but learn from their accumulated editing skills. 

#### Josie Benson (36/ female):
> I know exactly what I need and when I have found a trainer that can provide it, I want to be able to book their services quickly and easily, if possible, without putting my bank details in, as I can never find my card!!

### Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create a more interactive and specific version of my current website. Since the design of my first website I am a lot more tech savy and experienced and feel it is important that this shines through. I would like to create an __online extension of my personal training business and podcasting skills__. The website is aimed toward women seeking Pre and post natal specialist fitness support and anyone seeking my input on their podcast. I have used this project as an opportunity to collate all of the skills that I have developed in my experience in both fields and aim to make this website extremely easy to use and interactive enough for the user to feel that the information they wanted was easy to source. __I am paying close attention to the wordng and language__ as Pre and Post Natal exercise is still relatively new and sometimes intimidating for women, its deeply important that I do not make woemn feel that exdericsing during or thereafter their pregnancy should be prioritised over the other practical things they must do, rather as part of their self care. 

#### Site Owner Goals:
* Promote myself as a specialised Personal Trainer and Podcaster. 
* Generate a stream of new clients. 
* Provide enough information on the site to entice the types of clients with whom my expertise are best suited. 
* Display my credentials in a clear and concise format. 
* Inspire my clientelle to lead a healthier lifestyle for the right reasons, as opposed to body shaming them into trying to get fit. 
* Display all of my Podcatsing experience in an interactive and easily attainable way. 
* Insure that the site is aesthetically pleasing. 





## Design Choices: üé®

#####  Structure

The site is a scrolling and multiple pages site with 4 sections on the homepage and 3 seperate pages for the PT section, 1 seperate page for the POdcast section , a seperate page for About me and a seperate page for FAQ's. Originally I opted for a scrolling site, however when I realsied how much contnent i needed to out on the site, to try and messily limit it to a crolling site would have made the site look rushed, unprofessional and contribyte to a bad user experience.

In my opinion the site is still very accessible and gives the user the freedom to venture into the aspects that they are interested in, with a click and those who know eactly what they are looking for can easily naivgate to the relevant pages. 

#####  Colour scheme
I wanted the colour scheme of this project to elicit emotions of; motivation ; conversation and health. In order to achieve this difficult blend of emotions, i needed to carry out some research on the meanings and feelings assiciated with certain colours. 
I knew vaguely that green was associated with health because of new beginnings and seasonal indications from the spring months, but had no idea how best to convey the conversationalism with the podcast aspect of my site. I found <a href='https://www.templatemonster.com/blog/warm-cool-color-psychology-web-design/'>this</a> blog post, which explained that purple had soothing sensual and imaginative! It is also aesthetically very profesional, when placed with a range of other colours. To decide on what the other range of colours should look like, i turned to pinterest for some <a href='https://www.pinterest.co.uk/shamastock/wellness-color-palette-ideas/'> inspiration </a> I then used <a href= 'https://coolors.co/'>coolors.co</a> to help me find a fitting colour scheme, incorporating all the emotions i desired. A screenshot of the colouor scheme canbe found <a href="assets/logos/palette.pdf">here.</a>

##### Logo:
I decided to base my logo around the colour purple and then allow this to help me decide on the entire colour scheme. To design the temporary logo I used  <a href="https://hatchful.shopify.com/"> Hatchful.shopify.com</a> . Although this gave me a limited scope for design, I was able to use this tool to decide on a key image/ icon which ties both PT and Podcasting together.. Headphones-they are instantly assiciated with exercise and also audio.  I played around and came up with the logo you can at the top of this page. Alternatively the logo can be found <a href="assets/logos">here </a> Along with a screenshot of the creation process. I beleieved the logo should equally signify the importance of both of the skills i am using the website to advocate. 

##### Fonts: 
I chose to use the fonts <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?sidebar.open=true&selection.family=Lato"> Lato</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?selection.family=Lato|Montserrat&query=montser">Montserrat</a>. After looking at other fitness/ wellness or simply, health websited, i found the two fonts regularly appearing and realised that it was probably because they are easy to read and also have the scope to be pretty impactful.


##### Colours:
I wanted the colours to vary but also show continuity, this is why i made the background colour for the pT section on the home page, 'vermilion' and then the background colour for the corresponsding pt oages (outdoor.html, virtual.html and inHome.html) 'sage'. As there was only one seperate correspoding Podcast page (podcastJourney.html) I decided that tthey should have the continuity of the same colour ' dar slate gray', whih also complimented the accompanying pictures and videos very nicely. I used 'Onyx' as the font colour, on all the white background pages because i felt black was too harsha nd the slightl different 'Onyx' set the text and background colurs off nicely. 




## Wireframes: üîß
I built the wireframes for this project using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq mockups</a>. In my previous project, I did not adequately plan my project, this time i wanted to really utilise the benefits of setting out my plan in detail, it saved me so much time and gave me a lot more freedom to try out different ideas, should i need to!

## Testing: üîå


Test Planning: 
I was very concerned with functionality of my PT enquiry form, especially because it is this form which could potentially lose me a new client, if the user felt disatisfied with the functionality. 

Testing Stories:
I continued to test the function throughout the process and quickly realised that whilst the code I had used from my template js email was correct, i had used slightly ineffective code in my email.js file and corresponding html, because evrytime i tried to use the function to test it, i would not receuev an email and it would refresh my details everytime. After an in depth explanation from my tutpr i learnt that the 'onsubmit' action had built in functions, when if not accompanied by a return false action, meant that my code was being asked to send the form and refresh, virtually at the same time. Hence why i was not receieving the email and the form was refreshig details on every attempt.

I fixed this issue, by using the source option in dev tools, to look at where the code became unresponsive and found that I had also placed a comma in the wrong place too!

After resolving these issues, i found that my PT enquiry form, was working perfectly well!



Key aspects:
Design -

Plan üìù: One of my aims was for the cost of a personal training package to illuminate when the user hovers over the package. 

Implementation üè≠: I tried to initially do this in my css, howvere i could not target the correct elements in an effective way. I would have had to style quite a few 'a' elements and then 'a:hover' elements wich would have in turn, meant that i would have had to target each specific 'a' element and making it individual would have been tough! I eventually, decided to use javascript and the 'mouseenter' and 'mouseleave' functions to add specific css and then remove it. Giveing the appearance of a hover. I could also use 4 unique Id's on each PT page and only have to do the function for each id once within my script.js file, because the id's were each on different pages. 

Verdict ‚úÖ: It looks wonderful and i have the desired effect.

During the development process for this project, I was fortunate to not have to battle with many annoying bugs. Listed below are a few issues that I faced and overcame during the project.

js email

Plan üìù: I wanted my email function to work effectively and seamlessly 

Bugs: üêû
the email continued not to work and i realised that i hadnt listed the src and script in the correct place, i ghad placed it in the footer, as opposed to the header. Once corrected i was no longer getting the 'this fucntion has not been called error' This meant i could find the more critical issue within the code.

## Closing Notes:
Developing this project has taught me not just about coding, but methodical thinking in general. I feel that HTML and CSS are the second nature now! I have learnt the usefulness of Bootstrap and the importance of not over complicating the code.  In the future, I would like to implement other features like a live chat feature and add payment and social media links to the footer. Said online payment and social media accounts do not currently exist, but will in the future!
