            I wanted to become a PT to help women feel more comfortable, it
            sounds cliche I know but growing up I struggled with my weight and
            did everything in my power to get my size down, so I could 'fit in'.
            When I achieved my goal size, I was happy, but the attempts to 'fit
            in' didn't magically dissolve. It was through the respect for
            movement, the investment in my health and the belief that my body
            was honestly a prized vessel which I should treat with love, that
            made me able to block out all of the pressures and fears surrounding
            body image. I train women so that the exercise becomes a stress
            relief and a vice even, with the happy by-product of aesthetic
            changes. I do not encourage calorie counting and do not offer 'fast
            blasts' this is a journey and you need to be in it for the long
            haul.

            I want women to treat their health and fitness with the importance
            most men treat their weekly kick about with their friends.
            Unfortunately, society depicts an image of health being synonymous
            with wealth. It doesn't have to be, movement is second nature to us
            as humans, we need to connect back to that. Value ourselves for the
            wonderful beings we are. I want every woman everywhere to have the
            tools to change her body for the healthier.

            I train women throughout their pregnancy and after they have had
            their baby! I specialised in this because as women we are
            marginalised all the time, let alone when pregnant/ a new mum. I
            wanted to help women retain their identities and achieve their best
            health. you can learn a little about my journey<a

            During my experience, I have realised that there is still plenty of
            anxiety and worry around women exercising whilst pregnant. Equally,
            the limited information about the benefits of a new mum exercising
            is also part of the issue. I have put together a shortlist of some
            of the Frequently Asked Questions I am hit with all the time.<a

       I have a strict 24 hour cancellation policy. If you would like to rearrange a session, please give me a minimum
of 24 hours notice. If you do not comply with this rule, you will lose your session.
• Please pay your package total upfront, if this is not possible, you and I can workout a payment plan. I will not
accept payment per session.
• If you purchase a package and cannot complete the sessions for any reason, I will not refund payment of
unused sessions UNLESS there are extenuating circumstances. I will require proof, for example a Doctors
note/ new work contract, stipulating a relocation. HOWEVER your sessions can be frozen for up to 3 months.
*All decisions and approaches to moving forward in any of the above circumstances are at my discretion.
• If you decide to go for an outdoor package, please understand that we will more than likely experience bad
weather. If this will deter you from training this is not the right package for you. I will not accept bad weather as
a reason for a cancelled session.
• Please come to every session with a pro-active attitude. If you cant do an exercise, know that you are
struggling AT THE MOMENT but you WILL improve. </p>
