     <footer class="blockquote-footer heading"> Is it safe to exercise?</footer>
  <p class="mb-0">YES! Exercising is probably one of the safest things to do whilst your pregnant, the healthier you are, the healthier the baby will be and the stronger you are, the more luck you are going to have with the delivery AND when the baby arrives!<a href="https://youtu.be/FY9ZumupPbY" target="_blank"> But don't take my word for it.. </a> </p>

     <footer class="blockquote-footer heading"> Will I get fat?</footer>
  <p class="mb-0">Not many women know this, but during pregnancy it is only necessary that you put on 1-2 stones, (provided you are already average weight after falling pregnant ) I feel that the narrative of 'just getting fat' is harmful to women and reiterates the dismissal of women during and after pregnancy. </p>

  <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
     <footer class="blockquote-footer heading"> Will I get injured?</footer>
  <p class="mb-0">Whilst pregnant, your exercise abilities change day to day and trimester to trimester. Roughly.. through the first trimester you are physically not very different to when you were not pregnant, but you normally FEEL quite lethargic and nauseous, so its harder to motivate yourself to exercise and THAT IS FINE!
Second trimester.. You are normally a bit more used to the extra blood in your body, the hormone changes the increase on toilet breaks and the hormonal changes, so you are more engaged with the idea of exercising, HOWEVER your body's capacity has changed.. but only slightly! Your centre of gravity has now shifted (your blanace isnt great), you should avoid lifting things over your head (it can illicit high blood pressure) you should not be 'chancing' lifting weights. If you are a gym goer, you may push a little heavier on leg day, but now you're pregnant, that is not advisable, especially if you are alone. 
Now by the thrid trimester, you dont want to be doing any exercises that are throwing your balance off and you also want to avoid high intensity cardio and the guidelines from the second trimester still apply. 
So in short.. as lomng as you are being mindful and listening to your body whilst exercising, you should not be fearful of injury, ideally you shjould be training with a specialist though, maybe me? </p>

     <footer class="blockquote-footer heading"> Will the baby get injured?</footer>
  <p class="mb-0"> If you're following the above guidelines, no.</p>

  <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
     <footer class="blockquote-footer heading"> After having the baby, how soon until I can go back to the gym?</footer>
  <p class="mb-0"> This is TOTALLY based on you. Guidelines suggest that 2 weeks after a completely healthy, complication free delivery and 6 weeks for a c- section delivery. However, you shouldn't pressure yourself to force it, whatever feels best. I have had clients that have trained with me 1 week after having their baby and clients who have waited 6 months. 
‘Why can’t I get my flat tummy back?’ 
When you have your baby, your core separates to make room for the bubba. It takes a while (post pregnancy) for the core plates to fuse back together. ESPECIALLY if you have experienced Diastasis Recti throughout the pregnancy. This means that if you had a flat stomach to begin with, it may take some time to get it back, but isometric core strengthening exercises will help!</p>

       I have a strict 24 hour cancellation policy. If you would like to rearrange a session, please give me a minimum
of 24 hours notice. If you do not comply with this rule, you will lose your session.
• Please pay your package total upfront, if this is not possible, you and I can workout a payment plan. I will not
accept payment per session.
• If you purchase a package and cannot complete the sessions for any reason, I will not refund payment of
unused sessions UNLESS there are extenuating circumstances. I will require proof, for example a Doctors
note/ new work contract, stipulating a relocation. HOWEVER your sessions can be frozen for up to 3 months.
*All decisions and approaches to moving forward in any of the above circumstances are at my discretion.
• If you decide to go for an outdoor package, please understand that we will more than likely experience bad
weather. If this will deter you from training this is not the right package for you. I will not accept bad weather as
a reason for a cancelled session.
• Please come to every session with a pro-active attitude. If you cant do an exercise, know that you are
struggling AT THE MOMENT but you WILL improve. </p>
