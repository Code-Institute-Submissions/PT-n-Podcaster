    <h1> What is a Pre and Post Natal Personal Trainer?</h1>
    <p>Essentially, it means.. I train women throughout their pregnancy and after they have had their baby! <p>

    <h1> Why do that?</h1>
    <p>I have realised that I am most committed to supporting pre and post natal women with their Health & Fitness journey, because I think it is unfair that women are encouraged to lose themselves when they become a mum, as opposed to REINVENTING themselves! 
    
    There is not enough supporting research around the benefits of maintaining good health and fitness during pregnancy. I help women stay fit and active throughout the trimesters and prepare their body for the new addition by helping to strengthen their muscles. 
    
    Often, women need guidance post delivery, such as rebuilding and strengthening their core. I can help with that too!
    
    Simple alterations to a new mums routine, can be the difference between recovering well post birth and struggling throughout life. 

    For example, pelvic floor exercises are very simple to carry out, yet are not emphasised enough from the outset of pregnancy.
    </p>
<h1>
What makes me such an expert?</h1>
<p> I am a Level 4 qualified Personal Trainer specialising in Pre & Post Natal fitness.  I have trained over 20 women throughout their pregnancy and 45 post baby. 
</p>

<p> During my experience, I have realoised that there is still plenty of anxiety and worry around women exercising whilst pregnant. Equally, the limited information about the benefits of a new mum exercising are also part of the issue. I have put together a short list of some of the Frequently Asked Questions I am hit with all the time! <a href="">Enjoy</a> </p>
