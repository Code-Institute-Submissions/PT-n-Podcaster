    <h1 class="title"> What is a Pre and Post Natal Personal Trainer?</h1>
     <p class="paragraph">Essentially, it means.. I train women throughout their pregnancy and after they have had their baby! <p>

    <h2 class="heading"> Why do that?</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">I have realised that I am most committed to supporting pre and post natal women with their Health & Fitness journey, because I think it is unfair that women are encouraged to lose themselves when they become a mum, as opposed to REINVENTING themselves! 
    
    There is not enough supporting research around the benefits of maintaining good health and fitness during pregnancy. I help women stay fit and active throughout the trimesters and prepare their body for the new addition by helping to strengthen their muscles. 
    
    Often, women need guidance post delivery, such as rebuilding and strengthening their core. I can help with that too!
    
    Simple alterations to a new mums routine, can be the difference between recovering well post birth and struggling throughout life. 

    For example, pelvic floor exercises are very simple to carry out, yet are not emphasised enough from the outset of pregnancy.
    </p>
<h2 class="heading">
What makes me such an expert?</h2>
 <p class="paragraph"> I am a Level 4 qualified Personal Trainer specialising in Pre & Post Natal fitness.  I have trained over 20 women throughout their pregnancy and 45 post baby. 
</p>

 <p class="paragraph"> During my experience, I have realoised that there is still plenty of anxiety and worry around women exercising whilst pregnant. Equally, the limited information about the benefits of a new mum exercising are also part of the issue. I have put together a short list of some of the Frequently Asked Questions I am hit with all the time! <a href="">Enjoy</a> </p>

<h1 class="heading">I can train you in your home!</h1>

<div id="houseAnimation" class="col-4"> 
<p class="revealText"> I know how tough it can be when youre expecting, to make it to a certain location, even easy trips seem WAY longer.. Equally, when the little cherub arrives, sometimes you look back on third trimester waddling around as 'better times'. Regardless, I'm here to remove the barriers and be the solution! I can come to your home provided you live near any of the 3 map listed locations! </p>

    <h1 class="title"> Podcast host and guest 
    </h1>
     <p class="paragraph">My podcasting journey began when I founded the triend it podcast, I loved speaking on things I really cared about, getting feedback from other girls who looked like me and could relate to my experiences. I felt like I was becoming the represrentaion I would have loved to see when I was growing up. 

    Eventually, I was asked to be a guest on other podcasts! This was even more invigorating, because it had meant that people had recognised what i do and thought it was so great that they wanted to put it on their platforms and my poersoctive on things was reaching a wider range of people. 

    THEN, Tried It Podcast came to an end, I was heartbroken because i thought that this meant that was it for me and podcasting.. but NO.

    I realsied that Podcasting was a true and pure passion of mine. I needed to continue at all costs!! I started my own podcast Mayas minutes and conitued popping up on other peoples' episodes. 

    Podcasting empowered me and whilst i had no trouble finding or using my voice.. the actual production was very daunting to me.. so whether you want a guest, a host, a soundboard for your ideas, editing advice and support or just an ear to listen, im your girl. Im offering these services, because Podcasting has given me so much joy, but so many times I nearly gave up because of all the little niggly bits in between, I am trying to be the person to minimse those obstacles for you so that you can get to your end podcast faster!
