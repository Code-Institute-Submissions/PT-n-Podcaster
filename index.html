<h1 class="heading"> Ethos </h1>
</div>
<p>I wanted to become a PT to help women feel more comfortable, it sounds cliche i know but growing up i strugled with my weight and did everything in my power to get my size down, so i could 'fit in'. When i achieved my goal size, i was happy, but the attempts to 'fit in' didnt magically dissolve. It was thorugh the respect for movement, the investment in my health and the belief that my body was honestly a prized vessel which i should treat with love, that made me able to block out all of the pressures and fears surrounding body image. I train women so that the exercise becomes a stress relief and a vice even, with the happy by product of aesthetic changes. I do not encourage calorie counting and do not offer 'fast blasts' this is a journey and you need to be in it for the long haul. </p>

<h1 class="heading"> Mission </h1>
</div>
<p>I want women to be treat their health and fitness with the importance most men treat their weekly kick about with their freinds. Unfortunately society depicts an image of health being synonymous with wealth. It doesnt have to be, movement is literally second nature to us as humans, we need to connect back to that. Value ourselves for the wonderful beings we are. I want every woman everywehre to have the tools to change her body for the healthier.  </p>

<p> Essentially, it means.. I train women throughout their pregnancy and after they have had their baby! i specialised in this because as women we are marginalised all the time, let alone when pregnant/ a new mum. I wanted to help women retain their identities and achieve their best health. you can learn a little about my journey<a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/B5XTmeqg6Ce/?igshid=iaaqbpyw62ng"> here</a>

<p>During my experience, I have realoised that there is still plenty of anxiety and worry around women exercising whilst pregnant. Equally, the limited information about the benefits of a new mum exercising are also part of the issue.

    <p>
    My podcasting journey began when I founded the tried it podcast, I loved speaking on things I really cared about and getting feedback from other girls who looked like me and could relate to my experiences. I felt like I was becoming the representation I would have loved to see when I was growing up. 

    Eventually, I was asked to be a guest on other podcasts! This was even more invigorating, because it had meant that people had recognised what i do and thought it was so great that they wanted to put it on their platforms and my poersoctive on things was reaching a wider range of people. 

    THEN, Tried It Podcast came to an end, I was heartbroken because i thought that this meant that was it for me and podcasting.. but NO.

    I realsied that Podcasting was a true and pure passion of mine. I needed to continue at all costs!! I started my own podcast Mayas minutes and conitued popping up on other peoples' episodes. 

    Podcasting empowered me and whilst i had no trouble finding or using my voice.. the actual production was very daunting to me.. so whether you want a guest, a host, a soundboard for your ideas, editing advice and support or just an ear to listen, im your girl. Im offering these services, because Podcasting has given me so much joy, but so many times I nearly gave up because of all the little niggly bits in between, I am trying to be the person to minimse those obstacles for you so that you can get to your end podcast faster!
