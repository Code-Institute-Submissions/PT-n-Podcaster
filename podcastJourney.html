            My podcasting journey began when I founded the

          <p class="paragraph">
            I felt that there were not enough conversations about things I could
            relate too. I realised that, this must be the case for other women
            eho looked like me too!
          </p>

          <hr />
          <p class="paragraph">
            I started putting the feelers out ther, using my instagram to spread
            the word that I was on the hunt for a few women who also shared my
            vision. Eventually, Kedeisha Jade and I got together and Tried It
            podcast was born.
          </p>

          <hr />
          <p class="paragraph">
            We started recording weekly and sooner or later, we were getting
            feedback from other girls who loved listening to us. I was
            overwhelmed by how many women who could relate to my experiences
            reached out. I felt like I was becoming the representation I would
            have loved to see when I was growing up.
          </p>

          <hr />
          <p class="paragraph">
            Eventually, I was asked to be a guest on other podcasts! This was
            even more invigorating, because it had meant that people had
            recognised what I do and thought it was so great that they wanted to
            put it on their platforms! The idea that my perspective on things
            was reaching a wider range of people really excited me.
          </p>

          <hr />
          <p class="paragraph">
            THEN, Tried It Podcast came to an end, I was heartbroken because I
            hought that this meant that was it for me and podcasting.. But NO. I
            realsied that Podcasting was a true and pure passion of mine. I
            needed to continue at all costs!! I started my own podcast Mayas
            minutes and conitued popping up on other peoples' episodes.

       I have a strict 24 hour cancellation policy. If you would like to rearrange a session, please give me a minimum
of 24 hours notice. If you do not comply with this rule, you will lose your session.
• Please pay your package total upfront, if this is not possible, you and I can workout a payment plan. I will not
accept payment per session.
• If you purchase a package and cannot complete the sessions for any reason, I will not refund payment of
unused sessions UNLESS there are extenuating circumstances. I will require proof, for example a Doctors
note/ new work contract, stipulating a relocation. HOWEVER your sessions can be frozen for up to 3 months.
*All decisions and approaches to moving forward in any of the above circumstances are at my discretion.
• If you decide to go for an outdoor package, please understand that we will more than likely experience bad
weather. If this will deter you from training this is not the right package for you. I will not accept bad weather as
a reason for a cancelled session.
• Please come to every session with a pro-active attitude. If you cant do an exercise, know that you are
struggling AT THE MOMENT but you WILL improve. </p>
